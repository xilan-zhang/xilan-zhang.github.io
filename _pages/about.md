ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Xilan!

I am currently a first-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/research-impact/research-areas#ote) at Stanford University, specializing in organizations, technology, and entrepreneurship. I earned my bachelor's degree in economics and finance from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). During my undergraduate studies, I spent a year as a non-degree visiting student at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en), where I involved in research at the [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/). I am broadly interested in studying entrepreneurship, innovation, and organizations. Currently, my research interest is on identifying the determinants of resource mobilization under entrepreneurial settings. 

My Chinese name is prounounced "Ci-lan", with no "-tro" at the end. In my free time, I enjoy skiing and hunting for street art on electrical boxes. Please feel free to reach me at: [xilan.zhang01@gmail.com](mailto:xilan.zhang01@gmail.com) â€” I'm always open to new conversations!
