ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Xilan!

I'm a senior-year undergraduate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in [economics](https://ug.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and I expect to graduate in June 2024. Previously, I spent one year as a non-degree visiting student at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) while engaging in research activities at [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/).

I am broadly interested in studying work, labor, and organization. Currently, my research interest is on identifying the determinants of individual labor market and career outcomes, with a particular emphasis on cultural and network perspectives. I hope to understand the underlying factors driving disparities in individual employment outcomes and contribute to the efforts that bridge these gaps.

My name is prounounced "Ci-lan", with no "-tro" at the end. In my free time, I enjoy skiing and hunting for street art on electrical boxes.

Please feel free to reach me at: [xilan.zhang01@gmail.com](mailto:xilan.zhang01@gmail.com) â€” I'm always open to new conversations!
